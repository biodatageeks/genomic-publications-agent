We sequenced these sites in the MonoMAC patient, and while sequences of the –3.9, –2.8, and –1.8 kb sites were identical to the wild-type sequence, the +9.5 site contained a heterozygous 28-bp deletion at c.572+512del28 (Figure 1B). This 28-bp deletion excised an imperfect GATA motif (GATAG), the E-box of the conserved composite element (CATCTG), and 5 bp of the 8-bp spacer between the E-box and the AGATAA motif (Figure 1B)."

                "context": "While it was not possible to obtain HSPCs from the patient, peripheral blood was used to analyze allelic expression in small numbers of monocytes and T cells. The two alleles were differentiated by the presence of a known SNP, rs34799090 (c.481C>G), in exon 4, which causes the amino acid change P161A. Co-inheritance of SNP rs34799090 with the +9.5 deletion in one of the patient’s children confirmed that the SNP mapped to the same allele as the deletion (Figure 1C)."
