The mutation, c.1017+572C>T (i5C>T), is predicted to disrupt an ETS motif within intron 5 following the composite cis-element. Additionally, within the same region, 1 patient was identified with a 28 base deletion of intron 5 that eliminated the E-box and 5 bp of the spacer of the E-box/GATA composite element. 4.II.1\\tT/B/NK/mono\\t26\\tCMV, MAC, recurrent pneumonias, histoplasmosis\\tMDS\\tc.1017+572C>T\\ti5\\t1 25.I.1\\tT/B/NK/mono\\t13\\tHPV, Mycobacterium kansasii, MAC\\tMDS\\tc.1017+572C>T\\ti5\\t 11.II.1\\tB/NK/mono\\t9\\tHPV, VZV, treatment-resistant Candida thrush and vaginitis\\t+Abnormal megakaryocytes\\tc.1017+572C>T\\ti5\\t1 28.I.1\\tB/NK/mono\\t21\\tCMV pneumonia\\t+Abnormal megakaryocytes\\tc.1017+572C>T\\ti5\\t 4.II.5\\tB/NK\\t19\\tHPV\\tMDS\\tc.1017+572C>T\\ti5\\t1 4.I.1\\tMonocytosis\\t78\\tNone\\tCMML\\tc.1017+572C>T\\ti5\\t1 4.III.2\\tNK\\t23\\tNone\\tNone\\tc.1017+572C>T\\ti5\\t 4.III.3\\tNK\\t21\\tNone\\tNone\\tc.1017+572C>T\\ti5\\t Reduced expression of mutant allele in a patient with c.1017+572C>T.

M, K, and S refer to base calls of mixed nucleotide bases at a single site, A/C, G/T, and C/G, respectively. (B) GATA2 cDNA sequences from isolated granulocytes (Grans), CD3+ T-cells (CD3+), and CD3– PBMCs (CD3–) demonstrate reduced expression of c.1017+572C>T allele."
