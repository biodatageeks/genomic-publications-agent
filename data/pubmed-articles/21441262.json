                "context": "Patient 1, a 12 year-old girl, was referred at 7 years because of severe mental retardation and postnatal microcephaly. She is the fourth child of healthy parents and her three older sisters are healthy. She was born at 40 weeks gestation by natural delivery with birth weight 3350 g (0 SD), length 51 cm (0 SD), and OFC 32.5 cm (−1 SD). At 6 months, she was able to turn, but she has never been able to sit or stand. She did not react to visual and acoustic stimuli in infancy, but this improved at later ages. Ophthalmologic examination revealed convergent strabismus. At 7 months she developed seizures. EEG revealed spikes and sharp waves over the left centroparietal and both centrotemporal regions. She could speak single words at 1 year, but lost this ability by 2 years. She had gastroesophageal reflux and constipation. Her brain MRI demonstrated striking reduced volume of white matter in the anterior frontal lobes with mildly thick cortex, striking hypoplasia and dysplasia of the anterior corpus callosum resembling a sharp hook, and probably dysplastic hippocampus (figure 1E–H). Prenatal chromosome analysis revealed an apparently balanced chromosome translocation: 46,XX,t(2;14)(q13;q13). Chromosome analysis was normal in both parents, indicating that it occurred de novo (paternity confirmed). FISH analysis with fosmid F-1425A7 from chromosome 2 identified signals on 2q11.2 as well as the der(2) and der(14), indicating that this clone spanned the breakpoint (figure 3A and data not shown). No gene was directly disrupted by the breakpoint, although INPP4A is located 5–10 kb telomeric to the breakpoint (data not shown). A 1-bp deletion in Inpp4a encoding inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type I occurred in the spontaneous weeble mouse mutant, which has severe locomotor instability and significant neuronal loss in the cerebellum and hippocampal CA1 sector.24 In addition, patient 1 is heterozygous for the breakpoint close to INPP4A, and further the weeble phenotype is a recessive condition that differs significantly from the phenotype in this girl."

Both DNA sequence elements are evolutionary highly conserved and were found to drive expression of a reporter gene (lacZ) in mouse forebrain (http://enhancer.lbl.gov/frnt_page.shtml). These data suggest that translocation of either or both of these putative cis-regulatory elements to chromosome 2 may have caused dysregulated expression of FOXG1 in the translocation patient."
