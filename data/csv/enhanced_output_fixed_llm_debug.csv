The A allele is significantly overtransmitted (P = 1 x 10(-11)) in families with NSCL/P, in particular those with cleft lip but not cleft palate. Further, there is a dosage effect of the A allele, with a relative risk for cleft lip of 1.68 for the AG genotype and 2.40 for the AA genotype. EMSA and ChIP assays demonstrate that the risk allele disrupts the binding site of transcription factor AP-2alpha and expression analysis in the mouse localizes the enhancer activity to craniofacial and limb structures.

In a study of 690 European- and 192 Chinese-descent probands and their parents or controls, we demonstrate the ubiquity of a >4-fold susceptibility from a C-->T allele (rs2435357: p = 3.9 x 10(-43) in European ancestry; p = 1.1 x 10(-21) in Chinese samples) that probably arose once within the intronic RET enhancer MCS+9.7. With in vitro assays, we now show that the T variant disrupts a SOX10 binding site within MCS+9.7 that compromises RET transactivation. The T allele, with a control frequency of 20%-30%/47% and case frequency of 54%-62%/88% in European/Chinese-ancestry individuals, is involved in all forms of HSCR. It is marginally associated with proband gender (p = 0.13) and significantly so with length of aganglionosis (p = 7.6 x 10(-5)) and familiality (p = 6.2 x 10(-4)). The enhancer variant is more frequent in the common forms of male, short-segment, and simplex families whereas multiple, rare, coding mutations are the norm in the less common and more severe forms of female, long-segment, and multiplex families. The T variant also increases penetrance in patients with rare RET coding mutations. Thus, both rare and common mutations, individually and together, make contributions to the risk of HSCR. The distribution of RET variants in diverse HSCR patients suggests a ""cellular-recessive"" genetic model where both RET alleles' function is compromised. The RET allelic series, and its genotype-phenotype correlations, shows that success in variant identification in complex disorders may strongly depend on which patients are studied."

However, most of the cases are sporadic with an unknown genetic cause. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was the search for low penetrance variations within and around a conserved regulatory element in the intron 1 of PROP1, contributing to a multifactorial form of the disease in sporadic patients. METHODS AND PATIENTS: A fragment of 570 bp encompassing the conserved region was sequenced in 107 CPHD patients and 294 controls, and an association study was performed with the four identified variants, namely c.109+435G>A (rs73346254), c.109+463C>T (rs4498267), c.109+768C>G (rs4431364), and c.109+915_917ins/delTAG (rs148607624). The functional role of the associated polymorphisms was evaluated by luciferase reporter gene expression analyses and EMSA. RESULTS: A statistically significant increased frequency was observed in the patients for rs73346254A (P = 5 x 10(-4)) and rs148607624delTAG (P = 0.01) alleles. Among all the possible allele combinations, only the haplotype bearing both risk alleles showed a significantly higher frequency in the patients vs. controls (P = 4.7 x 10(-4)) and conferred a carrier risk of 4.19 (P = 1.2 x 10(-4)).

To address this, we selected 13 regions from GWASs and other studies, performed targeted sequencing in 1,409 Asian and European trios, and carried out a series of statistical and functional analyses. Within a cluster of strongly associated common variants near NOG, we found that one, rs227727, disrupts enhancer activity. We furthermore identified significant clusters of non-coding rare variants near NTN1 and NOG and found several rare coding variants likely to affect protein function, including four nonsense variants in ARHGAP29. We confirmed 48 de novo mutations and, based on best biological evidence available, chose two of these for functional assays. One mutation in PAX7 disrupted the DNA binding of the encoded transcription factor in an in vitro assay. The second, a non-coding mutation, disrupted the activity of a neural crest enhancer downstream of FGFR2 both in vitro and in vivo. This targeted sequencing study provides strong functional evidence implicating several specific variants as primary contributory risk alleles for nonsyndromic clefting in humans."

For all tested GREM1 variants, no significant sex-by-genotype interaction effects were observed. The sequencing analysis did not detect any rare variants implicated in the development of oral clefts. CONCLUSION: Our results might suggest that variants influencing GREM1 expression levels, rather than variants affecting the function of the encoded protein, are significant factors in NSCL/P etiology."

The aim of the present study was to find the GREM1 functional variants implicated in the aetiology of this common developmental anomaly in the Polish population. METHODS: Eight polymorphisms were genotyped in 334 NSCL/P patients and 955 controls. In addition, the GREM1 protein-coding region was sequenced in 96 NSCL/P patients. RESULTS: Significant association with a risk of oral clefts was found for 5 tested polymorphisms. The lowest p(trend) values were identified for rs16969681, rs16969816, and rs1258763 (p(trend) 4.09E-05, 3.35E-05, and 0.0002, respectively). The putative functional variant rs16969681, located in a region that has enhancer activity, was associated with a 2.6-fold lower risk for NSCL/P (odds ratio [OR] = 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.61, p = 2.37E-05). The previously reported association of rs1258763 with NSCL/P was replicated (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44-0.73; p = 1.10E-05). For all tested GREM1 variants, no significant sex-by-genotype interaction effects were observed. The sequencing analysis did not detect any rare variants implicated in the development of oral clefts. CONCLUSION: Our results might suggest that variants influencing GREM1 expression levels, rather than variants affecting the function of the encoded protein, are significant factors in NSCL/P etiology."
