11278651,"Cloning and characterization of LUN, a novel ring finger protein that is highly expressed in lung and specifically binds to a palindromic sequence.","We isolated cDNAs encoding a novel RING finger protein (LUN), the mRNAs of which were expressed at high levels in the lung. In situ hybridization revealed that LUN mRNAs were expressed in the alveolar epithelium of the lung. The LUN gene locus was assigned to chromosome 9p21, which contains candidate tumor suppressor genes associated with loss of heterozygosity in more than 86% of small cell lung cancers. We clarified that LUN is localized to the nucleus and reveals Zn(2+)-dependent DNA binding activity. The region from amino acids 51 to 374 of LUN is responsible for DNA binding. Furthermore, we identified a novel palindromic binding consensus (5'-TCCCAGCACTTTGGGA-3') for the LUN binding. Interestingly, this LUN binding palindromic sequence is found in the upstream transcriptional regulatory region of the E-cadherin gene and two intervening regions of the talin gene. Our results suggested that LUN might be an important trans-acting transcriptional regulator for lung cancer-associated genes including E-cadherin and talin genes.","Cloning and characterization of LUN, a novel ring finger protein that is highly expressed in lung and specifically binds to a palindromic sequence.

11313147,Structural characterization of the mouse Foxf1a gene.,"Members in the superfamily of the forkhead/winged-helix transcription factors are known to play a critical role in the control of cell differentiation and tissue development. To understand the regulation and function of these genes, we have initially isolated and characterized the mouse Foxf1a gene, a novel forkhead gene predominantly expressed in the lung. The mouse gene consists of two exons with the forkhead domain contained in exon 1, and is located at band E1 on chromosome 8. Amino acid sequence of the mouse protein shares a high degree of homology to that of the corresponding human protein. The tissue specificity of expression of the mouse gene also resembles that found in the human gene. This gene is primarily expressed in the lung, and to a lesser extent in placenta and tissues in gastrointestinal tract. The transcription start site was mapped to 113 nucleotides upstream from the putative translation initiation site. The promoter of the mouse gene is highly GC rich and contains neither a CAAT nor a TATA box. A series of luciferase report constructs driven by the promoter and various deletions in the 5' flanking region of the gene were constructed and employed in transient transfection studies using a line of SV40 transformed mouse lymph node endothelial cells (SVEC4-10), which express the endogenous Foxf1a gene, and a line of mouse hepatoma cells (Hepa 1-6), in which Foxf1a is not expressed. To our surprise, these reporter genes are equally active in both cell lines. Further studies have shown that the proximal 5' flanking sequence and exon 1 of the endogenous gene are highly methylated in Hepa 1-6 cells but not in SVEC4-10 cells, suggesting that DNA methylation but not cell-specific transcription factor(s) regulates cell specificity of gene expression in these cultured cells.","Structural characterization of the mouse Foxf1a gene.

11493558,"Haploinsufficiency of the forkhead gene Foxf1, a target for sonic hedgehog signaling, causes lung and foregut malformations.","The murine Foxf1 gene, encoding a forkhead - or winged helix - transcription factor, is expressed in splanchnic mesenchyme during organogenesis. The concentration of expression to subepithelial mesenchyme suggested that Foxf1 is activated by paracrine signals from endodermal epithelia. Homozygous Foxf1-null mice die before embryonic day 10, owing to defects in extra-embryonic mesoderm, and do not provide any information about the role of Foxf1 in morphogenesis of endodermally derived organs. We show that, on CD1 genetic background, Foxf1 heterozygote perinatal mortality is around 90%. The haploinsufficiency causes a variable phenotype that includes lung immaturity and hypoplasia, fusion of right lung lobes, narrowing of esophagus and trachea, esophageal atresia and tracheo-esophageal fistula. Similar malformations are observed in mutants that are defective in the sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway, and we show that exogenous Shh activates transcription of Foxf1 in developing lung. Foxf1 mRNA is absent in the lungs, foregut and sclerotomes of Shh(-/-) embryos, but persists in tissues where indian hedgehog (Ihh) is expressed. In lung organ cultures, activation of Foxf1 by Shh is counteracted by bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4). Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 10 and FGF7 both decrease Foxf1 expression and we speculate that this is mediated by transcriptional activation of epithelial Bmp4 (in the case of FGF10) and by inhibition of Shh expression for FGF7.","Haploinsufficiency of the forkhead gene Foxf1, a target for sonic hedgehog signaling, causes lung and foregut malformations.

11943666,Fusion of lung lobes and vessels in mouse embryos heterozygous for the forkhead box f1 targeted allele.,"Previously, we showed that newborn forkhead box (Fox)f1(+/-) mice with diminished pulmonary FoxF1 levels died of severe lung hemorrhage and exhibited abnormal formation of alveolar sacs and capillaries. Another group recently reported that Foxf1(+/-) mouse embryos displayed a number of organ and skeletal defects including fusion of lung lobes. However, identification of pulmonary genes whose altered expression was associated with the lobular fusion defect in Foxf1(+/-) lungs remains uncharacterized. The present study was conducted to determine the nature of the malformations leading to lung fusions in the FoxF1 embryos and to identify potential signaling pathways influenced by FoxF1 haploinsufficiency. We show that Foxf1(+/-) embryos exhibit defects in formation and branching of primary lung buds, which causes fusion of the right lung lobes and vessels. The severity of the Foxf1(+/-) lung fusions was correlated with decreased levels of FoxF1 mRNA. In situ hybridization studies demonstrated that the defective primary lung-bud development in early Foxf1(+/-) embryos was associated with fewer pulmonary mesenchymal-epithelial interfaces. Defects in branching morphogenesis in the Foxf1(+/-) embryos were associated with altered expression of the fibroblast growth factor-10, bone morphogenetic protein-4, and the Gli3 transcription factor, which are known to influence primary lung-bud development.","Fusion of lung lobes and vessels in mouse embryos heterozygous for the forkhead box f1 targeted allele.

12221085,"IKKalpha, IKKbeta, and NEMO/IKKgamma are each required for the NF-kappa B-mediated inflammatory response program.","The IKKbeta and NEMO/IKKgamma subunits of the NF-kappaB-activating signalsome complex are known to be essential for activating NF-kappaB by inflammatory and other stress-like stimuli. However, the IKKalpha subunit is believed to be dispensable for the latter responses and instead functions as an in vivo mediator of other novel NF-kappaB-dependent and -independent functions. In contrast to this generally accepted view of IKKalpha's physiological functions, we demonstrate in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that, akin to IKKbeta and NEMO/IKKgamma, IKKalpha is also a global regulator of tumor necrosis factor alpha- and IL-1-responsive IKK signalsome-dependent target genes including many known NF-kappaB targets such as serum amyloid A3, C3, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, IL-1 receptor antagonist, vascular endothelial growth factor, Ptx3, beta(2)-microglobulin, IL-1alpha, Mcp-1 and -3, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), Fas antigen, Jun-B, c-Fos, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Only a small number of NF-kappaB-dependent target genes were preferentially dependent on IKKalpha or IKKbeta. Constitutive expression of a trans-dominant IkappaBalpha superrepressor (IkappaBalphaSR) in wild type MEFs confirmed that these signalsome-dependent target genes were also dependent on NF-kappaB. A subset of NF-kappaB target genes were IKK-dependent in the absence of exogenous stimuli, suggesting that the signalsome was also required to regulate basal levels of activated NF-kappaB in established MEFs.

12447869,Expression profiling of liver cell lines expressing entire or parts of hepatitis C virus open reading frame.,"Although hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a causative agent of liver diseases, its mechanism of pathogenesis is still unclear, mainly because of the lack of adequate cell culture systems to support HCV infection and replication. In this report, we describe development and characterization of human hepatoma cell lines constitutively expressing entire (Hep394) or parts (Hep352, Hep3294) of the HCV open reading frame (ORF). The viral and cellular proteolytic machinery involved in the viral precursor processing was consistently functional, and processed HCV proteins were synthesized in these established cell lines. By using a cDNA microarray analysis coupled with semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we identified 12 genes up-regulated and 4 genes down-regulated in Hep394 cells. With regard to genes related to cell growth regulation, we found up-regulation of forkhead transcription factor FREAC-1, poly (A) binding protein PABP2, and Ras suppressor Rsu-1. Another category of changes in gene expression includes MHC antigens, which play an important role in the T-cell-mediated immune reaction in the liver. In conclusion, functional genomic approaches comparing expression among the different cell lines expressing parts of the HCV genome may promote our understanding of the molecular basis of pathogenicity of HCV infection.","Expression profiling of liver cell lines expressing entire or parts of hepatitis C virus open reading frame.

12761041,Gene expression differences in quiescent versus regenerating hair cells of avian sensory epithelia: implications for human hearing and balance disorders.,"The sensory receptors for hearing and balance are the hair cells of the cochlea and vestibular organs of the inner ear. Permanent hearing and balance deficits can be triggered by genetic susceptibilities or environmental factors such as infection. Unlike mammalian hair cells that have a limited capacity for regeneration, the vestibular organ of the avian ear is constantly undergoing hair cell regeneration, whereas the avian cochlea undergoes regeneration only when hair cells are damaged. In order to gain insights into the genetic programs that govern the regenerative capacity of hair cells, we interrogated custom human cDNA microarrays with sensory epithelial cell targets from avian inner ears. The arrays contained probes from conserved regions of approximately 400 genes expressed primarily in the inner ear and approximately 1500 transcription factors (TF). Highly significant differences were observed for 20 inner-ear genes and more than 80 TFs. Genes up-regulated in the cochlea included BMP4, GATA3, GSN, FOXF1 and PRDM7. Genes up-regulated in the utricle included SMAD2, KIT, beta-AMYLOID, LOC51637, HMG20B and CRIP2. Many of the highly significant changes were validated by Q-PCR and in situ methods. Some of the observed changes implicated a number of known biochemical pathways including the c-kit pathway previously observed in melanogenesis. Twenty differentially expressed TFs map to chromosomal regions harboring uncloned human deafness loci, and represent novel candidates for hearing loss. The approach described here also illustrates the power of utilizing conserved human cDNA probes for cross-species comparisons.","Gene expression differences in quiescent versus regenerating hair cells of avian sensory epithelia: implications for human hearing and balance disorders.

The underlying molecular mechanism is largely unknown. BMP-7 at 200 ng/ml completely inhibited myotube formation in C2C12 cells and dramatically induced alkaline phosphatase activity up to 20-fold when compared to untreated cells by day 12 in culture. The level of Runx2/Cbfa1 mRNA, a bone-specific transcription factor, was also stimulated up to 6-fold by BMP-7 with a peak at 24 h. In addition BMP-7 treatment stimulated a 55-fold increase in osteocalcin mRNA as early as 24 h after treatment. A novel finding was that the expression of the chondrocyte markers Sox9 and type II collagen was increased as well. Runx2/Cbfa1 is a molecular switch for osteoblast differentiation. To initiate the study of modulators of Runx2/Cbfa1, such as kinases and cofactors, during osteoblastic differentiation of C2C12 cells treated by BMP-7 in vitro, microarray analyses of gene expressions were performed. Microarray data suggested that a total of 882 transcripts were either up- or downregulated at least 2-fold.

Quantitative expression analyses of these genes in matched tumor and benign tissue from 13 patients showed that six of these 11 (WWOX, WFDC1, MAF, FOXF1, MVD and the predicted novel transcript Q9H0B8 (NM_031476)) had significant and consistent downregulation in the tumors relative to normal prostate tissue expression making them candidate tumor suppressor genes.",1,0,0,2,False
15136151,"Sonic hedgehog signaling regulates Gli3 processing, mesenchymal proliferation, and differentiation during mouse lung organogenesis.","Lack of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, mediated by the Gli proteins, leads to severe pulmonary hypoplasia. However, the precise role of Gli genes in lung development is not well established. We show Shh signaling prevents Gli3 proteolysis to generate its repressor forms (Gli3R) in the developing murine lung. In Shh(-/-) or cyclopamine-treated wild-type (WT) lung, we found that Gli3R level is elevated, and this upregulation appears to contribute to defects in proliferation and differentiation observed in the Shh(-/-) mesenchyme, where Gli3 is normally expressed. In agreement, we found Shh(-/-);Gli3(-/-) lungs exhibit enhanced growth potential. Vasculogenesis is also enhanced; in contrast, bronchial myogenesis remains absent in Shh(-/-);Gli3(-/-) compared with Shh(-/-) lungs. Genes upregulated in Shh(-/-);Gli3(-/-) relative to Shh(-/-) lung include Wnt2 and, surprisingly, Foxf1 whose expression has been reported to be Shh-dependent. Cyclins D1, D2, and D3 antibody labelings also reveal distinct expression patterns in the normal and mutant lungs. We found significant repression of Tbx2 and Tbx3, both linked to inhibition of cellular senescence, in Shh(-/-) and partial derepression in Shh(-/-); Gli3(-/-) lungs, while Tbx4 and Tbx5 expressions are less affected in the mutants. Our findings shed light on the role of Shh signaling on Gli3 processing in lung growth and differentiation by regulating several critical genes.","Sonic hedgehog signaling regulates Gli3 processing, mesenchymal proliferation, and differentiation during mouse lung organogenesis.

15229177,Function and regulation of FoxF1 during Xenopus gut development.,"Development of the visceral mesoderm is a critical process in the organogenesis of the gut. Elucidation of function and regulation of genes involved in the development of visceral mesoderm is therefore essential for an understanding of gut organogenesis. One of the genes specifically expressed in the lateral plate mesoderm, and later in its derivative, the visceral mesoderm, is the Fox gene FoxF1. Its function is critical for Xenopus gut development, and embryos injected with FoxF1 morpholino display abnormal gut development. In the absence of FoxF1 function, the lateral plate mesoderm, and later the visceral mesoderm, does not proliferate and differentiate properly. Region- and stage-specific markers of visceral mesoderm differentiation, such as Xbap and alpha-smooth muscle actin, are not activated. The gut does not elongate and coil. These experiments provide support for the function of FoxF1 in the development of visceral mesoderm and the organogenesis of the gut. At the molecular level, FoxF1 is a downstream target of BMP4 signaling. BMP4 can activate FoxF1 transcription in animal caps and overexpression of FoxF1 can rescue twinning phenotypes, which results from the elimination of BMP4 signaling. The cis-regulatory elements of FoxF1 are located within a 2 kb DNA fragment upstream of the coding region. These sequences can drive correct temporal-spatial expression of a GFP reporter gene in transgenic Xenopus tadpoles. These sequences represent a unique tool, which can be used to specifically alter gene expression in the lateral plate mesoderm.","Function and regulation of FoxF1 during Xenopus gut development.

15480423,Profiling the molecular difference between Patched- and p53-dependent rhabdomyosarcoma.,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a highly malignant tumor that is histologically related to skeletal muscle, yet genetic and molecular lesions underlying its genesis and progression remain largely unknown. In this study we have compared the molecular profiles of two different mouse models of RMS, each associated with a defined primary genetic defect known to play a role in rhabdomyosarcomagenesis in man. We report that RMS of heterozygous Patched1 (Ptch1) mice show less aggressive growth and a greater degree of differentiation than RMS of heterozygous p53 mice. By means of cDNA microarray analysis we demonstrate that RMS in Ptch1 mutants predominantly express a number of myogenic markers, including myogenic differentiation 1, myosin heavy chain, actin, troponin and tropomyosin, as well as genes associated with Hedgehog/Patched signaling like insulin-like growth factor 2, forkhead box gene Foxf1 and the growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible gene Gadd45a. In sharp contrast, RMS in p53 mutants display higher expression levels of cell cycle-associated genes like cyclin B1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and the proliferation marker Ki-67. These results demonstrate that different causative mutations lead to distinct gene expression profiles in RMS, which appear to reflect their different biological characteristics. Our results provide a first step towards a molecular classification of different forms of RMS. If the described differences can be confirmed in human RMS our results will contribute to a new molecular taxonomy of this cancer, which will be critical for gene mutation- and expression-specific therapy.","Profiling the molecular difference between Patched- and p53-dependent rhabdomyosarcoma.

15533815,Sequence and expression of the rainbow trout winged helix/forkhead transcription factor FoxF1.,"FoxF1 is a member of the winged helix/forkhead transcription factor gene family. We have cloned the cDNA encoding a rainbow trout FoxF1 homologue, and examined its developmental gene expression pattern. By 7 days postfertilization (dpf at 14 degrees C), FoxF1 is expressed throughout the alimentary tract in the mesenchymal cells adjacent to the endodermal epithelium, with intense signals on the dorsal side of the oral cavity and in the primitive stomach. As ontogeny proceeds, expression is down-regulated in the oral cavity and esophagus, but persists in the pharynx, stomach, and intestine. Hybridization signals are also detected in the developing liver, and in the mesenchyme layer around the notochord. From 18dpf onwards, dramatic changes occur in gene expression in the branchial region. As the gill filaments elongate from the branchial arches, FoxF1 begins to be expressed along the central cell cord running through each gill filament, and then switches over its rod-like expression to a repetitive pattern, alternating on either side along the proximal part of the filament. A signal is further localized to the primitive pillar cells as they form gill lamellae. In addition to illustrating the conserved FoxF1 expression pattern in the developing digestive tract and liver, the results indicate a close association of FoxF1 with the formation of the fish gills.","Sequence and expression of the rainbow trout winged helix/forkhead transcription factor FoxF1.

There is considerable clinical overlap between these children and individuals with the Ritscher-Schinzel (or cranio-cerebello-cardiac (3C)) syndrome (OMIM #220210). Clinical features of 3C syndrome include craniofacial anomalies (macrocephaly, prominent forehead and occiput, foramina parietalia, hypertelorism, down-slanting palpebral fissures, ocular colobomas, depressed nasal bridge, narrow or cleft palate, and low-set ears), cerebellar malformations (variable manifestations of a Dandy-Walker malformation with moderate mental retardation), and cardiac defects (primarily septal defects). Since the original report, over 25 patients with 3C syndrome have been reported. Recessive inheritance has been postulated based on recurrence in siblings born to unaffected parents and parental consanguinity in two familial cases. Molecular and cytogenetic mapping of the 6p deletions in these three families with subtelomeric deletions of chromosome 6p have defined a 1.3 Mb minimally deleted critical region. To determine if 6p deletions are common in 3C syndrome, we analyzed seven unrelated individuals with 3C syndrome for deletions of this region. Three forkhead genes (FOXF1 and FOXQ1 from within the critical region, and FOXC1 proximal to this region) were evaluated as potential candidate disease genes for this disorder.

To examine their transcriptional activity during mouse embryonic development, we generated transgenic mice in which the expression of the beta-galactosidase transgene was controlled by the -2.7-kb Foxf1 promoter region, the -5.3-kb Foxf1 promoter region, or the -5.3-kb Foxf1 promoter region fused to the 3'RE.
