11313147,Structural characterization of the mouse Foxf1a gene.,"Members in the superfamily of the forkhead/winged-helix transcription factors are known to play a critical role in the control of cell differentiation and tissue development. To understand the regulation and function of these genes, we have initially isolated and characterized the mouse Foxf1a gene, a novel forkhead gene predominantly expressed in the lung. The mouse gene consists of two exons with the forkhead domain contained in exon 1, and is located at band E1 on chromosome 8. Amino acid sequence of the mouse protein shares a high degree of homology to that of the corresponding human protein. The tissue specificity of expression of the mouse gene also resembles that found in the human gene. This gene is primarily expressed in the lung, and to a lesser extent in placenta and tissues in gastrointestinal tract. The transcription start site was mapped to 113 nucleotides upstream from the putative translation initiation site. The promoter of the mouse gene is highly GC rich and contains neither a CAAT nor a TATA box. A series of luciferase report constructs driven by the promoter and various deletions in the 5' flanking region of the gene were constructed and employed in transient transfection studies using a line of SV40 transformed mouse lymph node endothelial cells (SVEC4-10), which express the endogenous Foxf1a gene, and a line of mouse hepatoma cells (Hepa 1-6), in which Foxf1a is not expressed. To our surprise, these reporter genes are equally active in both cell lines. Further studies have shown that the proximal 5' flanking sequence and exon 1 of the endogenous gene are highly methylated in Hepa 1-6 cells but not in SVEC4-10 cells, suggesting that DNA methylation but not cell-specific transcription factor(s) regulates cell specificity of gene expression in these cultured cells.",Gene,2001,V W Chang,"Structural characterization of the mouse Foxf1a gene.

Permanent hearing and balance deficits can be triggered by genetic susceptibilities or environmental factors such as infection. Unlike mammalian hair cells that have a limited capacity for regeneration, the vestibular organ of the avian ear is constantly undergoing hair cell regeneration, whereas the avian cochlea undergoes regeneration only when hair cells are damaged. In order to gain insights into the genetic programs that govern the regenerative capacity of hair cells, we interrogated custom human cDNA microarrays with sensory epithelial cell targets from avian inner ears. The arrays contained probes from conserved regions of approximately 400 genes expressed primarily in the inner ear and approximately 1500 transcription factors (TF).

Elucidation of function and regulation of genes involved in the development of visceral mesoderm is therefore essential for an understanding of gut organogenesis. One of the genes specifically expressed in the lateral plate mesoderm, and later in its derivative, the visceral mesoderm, is the Fox gene FoxF1. Its function is critical for Xenopus gut development, and embryos injected with FoxF1 morpholino display abnormal gut development. In the absence of FoxF1 function, the lateral plate mesoderm, and later the visceral mesoderm, does not proliferate and differentiate properly. Region- and stage-specific markers of visceral mesoderm differentiation, such as Xbap and alpha-smooth muscle actin, are not activated. The gut does not elongate and coil. These experiments provide support for the function of FoxF1 in the development of visceral mesoderm and the organogenesis of the gut. At the molecular level, FoxF1 is a downstream target of BMP4 signaling. BMP4 can activate FoxF1 transcription in animal caps and overexpression of FoxF1 can rescue twinning phenotypes, which results from the elimination of BMP4 signaling.

We report that RMS of heterozygous Patched1 (Ptch1) mice show less aggressive growth and a greater degree of differentiation than RMS of heterozygous p53 mice.

From 18dpf onwards, dramatic changes occur in gene expression in the branchial region. As the gill filaments elongate from the branchial arches, FoxF1 begins to be expressed along the central cell cord running through each gill filament, and then switches over its rod-like expression to a repetitive pattern, alternating on either side along the proximal part of the filament.

Epidemiological, experimental, and clinical studies provide evidence that antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and several other phytochemicals possess unique modes of action against cancer growth. However, the mode of action of several of these agents at the gene transcription level is not completely understood. Completion of the human genome sequence and the advent of DNA microarrays using cDNAs enhanced the detection and identification of hundreds of differentially expressed genes in response to anticancer drugs or chemopreventive agents. In this review, we are presenting an extensive analysis of the key findings from studies using potential chemopreventive agents on global gene expression patterns, which lead to the identification of cancer drug targets. The summary of the study reports discussed in this review explains the extent of gene alterations mediated by more than 20 compounds including antioxidants, fatty acids, NSAIDs, phytochemicals, retinoids, selenium, vitamins, aromatase inhibitor, lovastatin, oltipraz, salvicine, and zinc. The findings from these studies further reveal the utility of DNA microarray in characterizing and quantifying the differentially expressed genes that are possibly reprogrammed by the above agents against colon, breast, prostate, lung, liver, pancreatic and other cancer types.

ARMS, the more aggressive subtype, is associated in most cases with unique recurrent translocations fusing the PAX3 or PAX7 transcription factor genes to FKHR. In contrast, ERMS lacks unique genetic alterations. To identify novel diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets, we analysed the global gene expression profiles of these two RMS subtypes in 23 ARMS (16 PAX3-FKHR, 7 PAX7-FKHR) and 15 ERMS (all PAX-FKHR-negative) using Affymetrix HG-U133A oligonucleotide arrays. A statistically stringent supervised comparison of the ARMS and ERMS expression profiles revealed 121 genes that were significantly differentially expressed, of which 112 were higher in ARMS, including genes of interest as potential diagnostic markers or therapeutic targets, such as CNR1, PIPOX (sarcosine oxidase), and TFAPbeta.

Optical projection tomography (OPT) is a new, rapid and non-invasive technique for three-dimensional (3D) imaging of small biological tissue specimens that allows visualization of the tissue distribution of RNA in developing organs while also recording morphology. To explore the application of OPT in this context, we visualized Shh and Foxf1 gene expression patterns in the mouse foregut and lung buds at several stages of development. Time-mated CBA/Ca mice were harvested on embryonic days 9-12. The embryos were stained following whole mount in situ hybridization with labelled RNA probes to detect Shh and Foxf1 transcripts at each stage.

19220249,Gene expression of forkhead transcription factors in the normal and diseased human prostate.,"OBJECTIVE To assess the expression of forkhead transcription factors (FOX) in normal prostate and prostate diseases, as since the first FOX was identified, its family members have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including embryonic development and disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS We analysed a set of 12 different FOX genes by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in prostate zones, prostate cancer, lymph node metastases, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), xenografts and several prostate cell lines. RESULTS There were striking differences among the expression of various FOX family members; most prominent were the high expression of FOXF1 and FOXF2 in the normal prostate transition zone and BPH, and their decreased expression in prostate cancer. Interestingly, although the FOXF genes are stroma-specific, some of the androgen-independent prostate cancer xenografts uniquely express these two genes. FOXD1 and FOXD2 were more highly expressed in prostate cancer and lymph node metastases. FOXA1 and FOXC1 have an opposite expression pattern for androgen-dependent growth of prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts. CONCLUSIONS Various members of the FOX family are differentially expressed in the zones of the normal prostate and in benign and malignant outgrowths.

19952285,Long-range transcriptional control of progesterone receptor gene expression.,"Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) binds to specific target DNA sequences, estrogen response elements (EREs), to regulate estrogen-responsive gene expression. The progesterone receptor (PR) gene has been used extensively as a marker of estrogen responsiveness. Although we previously identified cis elements within 1 kb of the PR-B transcription start site that are associated with ERalpha and help to confer estrogen responsiveness, the identification of ERalpha binding sites far removed from the transcription start site suggested that long-range regulation of this gene may occur. We now show that eight regions of the PR gene from 311 kb upstream to 4 kb downstream of the PR-B transcription start site interact with ERalpha and that coactivator proteins and acetylated histones are selectively associated with these gene regions. Specific PR gene regions confer estrogen responsiveness to a heterologous reporter plasmid, and mutation of EREs within these regions diminishes estrogen-induced transactivation. Importantly, chromosome conformation capture assays reveal ERalpha- and ligand-dependent interactions between proximal and distal PR gene regions. Taken together, our studies suggest that distal regions of the PR gene participate in the dynamic regulation of this gene and that the coordinated action of proximal and distal PR gene regions allows cells to respond to changes in hormone levels with extraordinary versatility and sensitivity.","Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",2010,Jamie Bon&#xe9;y-Montoya,"Long-range transcriptional control of progesterone receptor gene expression. Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) binds to specific target DNA sequences, estrogen response elements (EREs), to regulate estrogen-responsive gene expression. The progesterone receptor (PR) gene has been used extensively as a marker of estrogen responsiveness. Although we previously identified cis elements within 1 kb of the PR-B transcription start site that are associated with ERalpha and help to confer estrogen responsiveness, the identification of ERalpha binding sites far removed from the transcription start site suggested that long-range regulation of this gene may occur.

20009030,Overexpression of Foxf2 in adipose tissue is associated with lower levels of IRS1 and decreased glucose uptake in vivo.,"Many members of the forkhead genes family of transcription factors have been implicated as important regulators of metabolism, in particular, glucose homeostasis, e.g., Foxo1, Foxa3, and Foxc2. The purpose of this study was to exploit the possibility that yet unknown members of this gene family play a role in regulating glucose tolerance in adipocytes. We identified Foxf2 in a screen for adipose-expressed forkhead genes. In vivo overexpression of Foxf2 in an adipose tissue-restricted fashion demonstrated that such mice display a significantly induced insulin secretion in response to an intravenous glucose load compared with wild-type littermates. In response to increased Foxf2 expression, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) mRNA and protein levels are significantly downregulated in adipocytes; however, the ratio of serine vs. tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 seems to remain unaffected. Furthermore, adipocytes overexpressing Foxf2 have a significantly lower insulin-mediated glucose uptake compared with wild-type adipocytes. These findings argue that Foxf2 is a previously unrecognized regulator of cellular and systemic whole body glucose tolerance, at least in part, due to lower levels of IRS1. Foxf2 and its downstream target genes can provide new insights with regard to identification of novel therapeutic targets.",American journal of physiology.

20058200,Isolation and differentiation of chondrocytic cells derived from human embryonic stem cells using dlk1/FA1 as a novel surface marker.,"Few surface markers are available to monitor lineage differentiation during chondrogenesis. Recently, delta-like1/fetal antigen1 (dlk1/FA1), a transmembrane protein of the Notch/Delta/Serrata family, was shown to be essential for inducing early chondrogenesis. Thus, we investigated the possible use of dlk1/FA1 as a novel surface marker for chondroprogenitor cells during hESC differentiation. We found that, Dlk1/FA1 is expressed specifically in cells undergoing transition from proliferating to prehypertrophic chondrocytes during endochondral ossification of the mouse limb. In hESC cells, dlk1/FA1 was not expressed by undifferentiated hESC, but expressed during in vitro embryoid bodies (hEBs) formation upon down-regulation of undifferentiated markers e.g. Oct 3/4. Similarly, dlk1/FA1 was expressed in chondrocytic cells during in vivo teratoma formation. Interestingly, treatment of hEBs with Activin B, a member of TGF-ss family, markedly increased Dlk1 expression in association with up-regulation of the mesoderm-specific markers (e.g. FOXF1, KDR and VE-cadherin) and SOX9. dlk1/FA1(+) cells isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) were capable of differentiating into chondrocytic cells when cultured as micromass pellets in a xeno-free system containing TGFbeta1. In conclusion, we identified dlk1/FA1 as a novel marker of chondroprogenitor cells that undergo embryonic lineage progression from proliferation to the prehypertrophic stage.

20145151,Nuclear Janus-activated kinase 2/nuclear factor 1-C2 suppresses tumorigenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by repressing Forkhead box F1.,"Progression to metastasis is the proximal cause of most cancer-related mortality. Yet much remains to be understood about what determines the spread of tumor cells. This paper describes a novel pathway in breast cancer that regulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), motility, and invasiveness. We identify two transcription factors, nuclear factor 1-C2 (NF1-C2) and Forkhead box F1 (FoxF1), downstream of prolactin/nuclear Janus-activated kinase 2, with opposite effects on these processes. We show that NF1-C2 is lost during mammary tumor progression and is almost invariably absent from lymph node metastases. NF1-C2 levels in primary tumors correlate with better patient survival. Manipulation of NF1-C2 levels by expression of a stabilized version or using small interfering RNA showed that NF1-C2 counteracts EMT, motility, invasiveness, and tumor growth. FoxF1 was found to be a direct repressed target of NF1-C2. We provide the first evidence for a role of FoxF1 in cancer and in the regulation of EMT in cells of epithelial origin. Overexpression of FoxF1 was associated with a mesenchymal phenotype, increased invasiveness in vitro, and enhanced growth of breast carcinoma xenografts in nude mice. The relevance of these findings is strengthened by the correlation between FoxF1 expression and a mesenchymal phenoype in breast cancer cell isolates, consistent with the interpretation that FoxF1 promotes invasion and metastasis.",Cancer research,2010,Jeanette Nilsson,"Nuclear Janus-activated kinase 2/nuclear factor 1-C2 suppresses tumorigenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by repressing Forkhead box F1.

The signaling for ATP-sensitive potassium channel expression is still unknown. We tested involvement of biochemical and biophysical parameters and potential transcription factors Forkhead box (FOX) and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1alpha). Right atrial tissues were obtained during surgery from 28 children with heart disease. Expression of K(+)-inward-rectifier subunits Kir6.1/Kir6.2; sulfonyl urea receptors (SURs) SUR1A/B and SUR2A/B; and FOX class O (FOXO) 1, FOXO3, FOXF2, and HIF-1alpha were related to 31 parameters, including personal data, blood chemistry, and echocardiography. Venous hypoxemia (but not other ischemia indicators, such as venous hypercapnia or low glucose) predicts increased Kir6.1 (P&lt;0.003) and Kir6.2 (P&lt;0.03) protein. Kir6.1 associates with SUR2A/B mRNA (P&lt;0.05) and correlates with FOXOs (P&lt;0.002). FOXOs correlate with HIF-1alpha (P&lt;0.01) and HIF-1alpha with venous hypoxemia (P&lt;0.003). Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays suggest causal links among hypoxia, HIF-1alpha, FOXO1, and Kir6.1. To mimic mild ischemia encountered in some patients, cultured rat atrial myocytes were tested in hypoxia, hypercapnia, or low glucose, with normal conditions serving as the control. Mild hypoxia (24-hour) increases expression of HIF-1alpha, FOXO1, and SUR2A/B/Kir6.1 in culture (P&lt;0.01), whereas hypercapnia and low glucose have no or opposite effects.
