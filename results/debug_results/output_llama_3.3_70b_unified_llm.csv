The text explicitly connects the variant to the IRF6 gene.,10,"Previously we have shown that nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) is strongly associated with SNPs in IRF6 (interferon regulatory factor 6). Here, we use multispecies sequence comparisons to identify a common SNP (rs642961, G>A) in a newly identified IRF6 enhancer. The A allele is significantly overtransmitted (P = 1 x 10(-11)) in families with NSCL/P, in particular those with cleft lip but not cleft palate. Further, there is a dosage effect of the A allele, with a relative risk for cleft lip of 1.68 for the AG genotype and 2.40 for the AA genotype. EMSA and ChIP assays demonstrate that the risk allele disrupts the binding site of transcription factor AP-2alpha and expression analysis in the mouse localizes the enhancer activity to craniofacial and limb structures. Our findings place IRF6 and AP-2alpha in the same developmental pathway and identify a high-frequency variant in a regulatory element contributing substantially to a common, complex disorder."

The syndrome varies from asymptomatic to diffuse hypothyroidism, to pituitary-selective resistance with predominance of hyperthyroid signs and symptoms.

The THRB gene encodes two main isoforms, TR beta1 which is widely distributed, and TR beta2, whose expression is limited to the cochlea, retina, hypothalamus, and pituitary. Recent data demonstrated that in mice an intron enhancer region plays a critical role in the pituitary expression of the beta2 isoform of the receptor. We thus hypothesized that polymorphisms in the human homologous region could modulate the pituitary expression of the mutated gene contributing to the clinical presentation of RTH. METHODS: Screening and in vitro characterization of polymorphisms of the intron enhancer region of the THRB gene in the index case of pituitary-selective RTH.

The THRB gene encodes two main isoforms, TR beta1 which is widely distributed, and TR beta2, whose expression is limited to the cochlea, retina, hypothalamus, and pituitary. Recent data demonstrated that in mice an intron enhancer region plays a critical role in the pituitary expression of the beta2 isoform of the receptor. We thus hypothesized that polymorphisms in the human homologous region could modulate the pituitary expression of the mutated gene contributing to the clinical presentation of RTH. METHODS: Screening and in vitro characterization of polymorphisms of the intron enhancer region of the THRB gene in the index case of pituitary-selective RTH. RESULTS: The index case of pituitary-selective resistance is characterized by the missense R338W exon 9 mutation in cis with two common SNPs, rs2596623T and rs2596622C, located in the intron enhancer region of the THRB gene. Reporter gene assay experiments in GH3 pituitary-derived cells indicate that rs2596623T generates an increased pituitary cell-specific activity of the TR beta2 promoter suggesting that rs2596623T leads to pituitary over-expression of the mutant allele. CONCLUSIONS: The combined coding mutation and non-coding SNP therefore generate a tissue-specific dominant-negative condition recapitulating the patient's peculiar phenotype.

This haplotype determined a significant decrease of the luciferase activity in comparison with a basal promoter and the other allelic combinations in GH4C and MCF7 cells (P = 4.6 x 10(-6); P = 5.5 x 10(-4), respectively). The EMSA showed a differential affinity for nuclear proteins for the alternative alleles of the two associated variations. CONCLUSIONS: Variations with a functional significance conferring susceptibility to CPHD have been identified in the PROP1 gene, indicating a multifactorial origin of this disorder in sporadic cases."

The functional role of the associated polymorphisms was evaluated by luciferase reporter gene expression analyses and EMSA. RESULTS: A statistically significant increased frequency was observed in the patients for rs73346254A (P = 5 x 10(-4)) and rs148607624delTAG (P = 0.01) alleles. Among all the possible allele combinations, only the haplotype bearing both risk alleles showed a significantly higher frequency in the patients vs. controls (P = 4.7 x 10(-4)) and conferred a carrier risk of 4.19 (P = 1.2 x 10(-4)). This haplotype determined a significant decrease of the luciferase activity in comparison with a basal promoter and the other allelic combinations in GH4C and MCF7 cells (P = 4.6 x 10(-6); P = 5.5 x 10(-4), respectively). The EMSA showed a differential affinity for nuclear proteins for the alternative alleles of the two associated variations. CONCLUSIONS: Variations with a functional significance conferring susceptibility to CPHD have been identified in the PROP1 gene, indicating a multifactorial origin of this disorder in sporadic cases."

This haplotype determined a significant decrease of the luciferase activity in comparison with a basal promoter and the other allelic combinations in GH4C and MCF7 cells (P = 4.6 x 10(-6); P = 5.5 x 10(-4), respectively). The EMSA showed a differential affinity for nuclear proteins for the alternative alleles of the two associated variations.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was the search for low penetrance variations within and around a conserved regulatory element in the intron 1 of PROP1, contributing to a multifactorial form of the disease in sporadic patients. METHODS AND PATIENTS: A fragment of 570 bp encompassing the conserved region was sequenced in 107 CPHD patients and 294 controls, and an association study was performed with the four identified variants, namely c.109+435G>A (rs73346254), c.109+463C>T (rs4498267), c.109+768C>G (rs4431364), and c.109+915_917ins/delTAG (rs148607624). The functional role of the associated polymorphisms was evaluated by luciferase reporter gene expression analyses and EMSA. RESULTS: A statistically significant increased frequency was observed in the patients for rs73346254A (P = 5 x 10(-4)) and rs148607624delTAG (P = 0.01) alleles. Among all the possible allele combinations, only the haplotype bearing both risk alleles showed a significantly higher frequency in the patients vs. controls (P = 4.7 x 10(-4)) and conferred a carrier risk of 4.19 (P = 1.2 x 10(-4)). This haplotype determined a significant decrease of the luciferase activity in comparison with a basal promoter and the other allelic combinations in GH4C and MCF7 cells (P = 4.6 x 10(-6); P = 5.5 x 10(-4), respectively). The EMSA showed a differential affinity for nuclear proteins for the alternative alleles of the two associated variations. CONCLUSIONS: Variations with a functional significance conferring susceptibility to CPHD have been identified in the PROP1 gene, indicating a multifactorial origin of this disorder in sporadic cases."

METHODS AND PATIENTS: A fragment of 570 bp encompassing the conserved region was sequenced in 107 CPHD patients and 294 controls, and an association study was performed with the four identified variants, namely c.109+435G>A (rs73346254), c.109+463C>T (rs4498267), c.109+768C>G (rs4431364), and c.109+915_917ins/delTAG (rs148607624). The functional role of the associated polymorphisms was evaluated by luciferase reporter gene expression analyses and EMSA. RESULTS: A statistically significant increased frequency was observed in the patients for rs73346254A (P = 5 x 10(-4)) and rs148607624delTAG (P = 0.01) alleles. Among all the possible allele combinations, only the haplotype bearing both risk alleles showed a significantly higher frequency in the patients vs. controls (P = 4.7 x 10(-4)) and conferred a carrier risk of 4.19 (P = 1.2 x 10(-4)). This haplotype determined a significant decrease of the luciferase activity in comparison with a basal promoter and the other allelic combinations in GH4C and MCF7 cells (P = 4.6 x 10(-6); P = 5.5 x 10(-4), respectively). The EMSA showed a differential affinity for nuclear proteins for the alternative alleles of the two associated variations. CONCLUSIONS: Variations with a functional significance conferring susceptibility to CPHD have been identified in the PROP1 gene, indicating a multifactorial origin of this disorder in sporadic cases."

Among all the possible allele combinations, only the haplotype bearing both risk alleles showed a significantly higher frequency in the patients vs. controls (P = 4.7 x 10(-4)) and conferred a carrier risk of 4.19 (P = 1.2 x 10(-4)). This haplotype determined a significant decrease of the luciferase activity in comparison with a basal promoter and the other allelic combinations in GH4C and MCF7 cells (P = 4.6 x 10(-6); P = 5.5 x 10(-4), respectively). The EMSA showed a differential affinity for nuclear proteins for the alternative alleles of the two associated variations. CONCLUSIONS: Variations with a functional significance conferring susceptibility to CPHD have been identified in the PROP1 gene, indicating a multifactorial origin of this disorder in sporadic cases."

METHODS AND PATIENTS: A fragment of 570 bp encompassing the conserved region was sequenced in 107 CPHD patients and 294 controls, and an association study was performed with the four identified variants, namely c.109+435G>A (rs73346254), c.109+463C>T (rs4498267), c.109+768C>G (rs4431364), and c.109+915_917ins/delTAG (rs148607624). The functional role of the associated polymorphisms was evaluated by luciferase reporter gene expression analyses and EMSA. RESULTS: A statistically significant increased frequency was observed in the patients for rs73346254A (P = 5 x 10(-4)) and rs148607624delTAG (P = 0.01) alleles. Among all the possible allele combinations, only the haplotype bearing both risk alleles showed a significantly higher frequency in the patients vs. controls (P = 4.7 x 10(-4)) and conferred a carrier risk of 4.19 (P = 1.2 x 10(-4)). This haplotype determined a significant decrease of the luciferase activity in comparison with a basal promoter and the other allelic combinations in GH4C and MCF7 cells (P = 4.6 x 10(-6); P = 5.5 x 10(-4), respectively). The EMSA showed a differential affinity for nuclear proteins for the alternative alleles of the two associated variations. CONCLUSIONS: Variations with a functional significance conferring susceptibility to CPHD have been identified in the PROP1 gene, indicating a multifactorial origin of this disorder in sporadic cases."

Within a cluster of strongly associated common variants near NOG, we found that one, rs227727, disrupts enhancer activity. We furthermore identified significant clusters of non-coding rare variants near NTN1 and NOG and found several rare coding variants likely to affect protein function, including four nonsense variants in ARHGAP29. We confirmed 48 de novo mutations and, based on best biological evidence available, chose two of these for functional assays. One mutation in PAX7 disrupted the DNA binding of the encoded transcription factor in an in vitro assay. The second, a non-coding mutation, disrupted the activity of a neural crest enhancer downstream of FGFR2 both in vitro and in vivo.

The lowest p(trend) values were identified for rs16969681, rs16969816, and rs1258763 (p(trend) 4.09E-05, 3.35E-05, and 0.0002, respectively). The putative functional variant rs16969681, located in a region that has enhancer activity, was associated with a 2.6-fold lower risk for NSCL/P (odds ratio [OR] = 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.61, p = 2.37E-05). The previously reported association of rs1258763 with NSCL/P was replicated (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44-0.73; p = 1.10E-05). For all tested GREM1 variants, no significant sex-by-genotype interaction effects were observed. The sequencing analysis did not detect any rare variants implicated in the development of oral clefts. CONCLUSION: Our results might suggest that variants influencing GREM1 expression levels, rather than variants affecting the function of the encoded protein, are significant factors in NSCL/P etiology."

METHODS: Eight polymorphisms were genotyped in 334 NSCL/P patients and 955 controls. In addition, the GREM1 protein-coding region was sequenced in 96 NSCL/P patients. RESULTS: Significant association with a risk of oral clefts was found for 5 tested polymorphisms. The lowest p(trend) values were identified for rs16969681, rs16969816, and rs1258763 (p(trend) 4.09E-05, 3.35E-05, and 0.0002, respectively). The putative functional variant rs16969681, located in a region that has enhancer activity, was associated with a 2.6-fold lower risk for NSCL/P (odds ratio [OR] = 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.61, p = 2.37E-05). The previously reported association of rs1258763 with NSCL/P was replicated (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44-0.73; p = 1.10E-05). For all tested GREM1 variants, no significant sex-by-genotype interaction effects were observed. The sequencing analysis did not detect any rare variants implicated in the development of oral clefts. CONCLUSION: Our results might suggest that variants influencing GREM1 expression levels, rather than variants affecting the function of the encoded protein, are significant factors in NSCL/P etiology."
