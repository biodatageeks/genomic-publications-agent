The T variant also increases penetrance in patients with rare RET coding mutations. Thus, both rare and common mutations, individually and together, make contributions to the risk of HSCR.

The THRB gene encodes two main isoforms, TR beta1 which is widely distributed, and TR beta2, whose expression is limited to the cochlea, retina, hypothalamus, and pituitary. Recent data demonstrated that in mice an intron enhancer region plays a critical role in the pituitary expression of the beta2 isoform of the receptor.

However, most of the cases are sporadic with an unknown genetic cause. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was the search for low penetrance variations within and around a conserved regulatory element in the intron 1 of PROP1, contributing to a multifactorial form of the disease in sporadic patients. METHODS AND PATIENTS: A fragment of 570 bp encompassing the conserved region was sequenced in 107 CPHD patients and 294 controls, and an association study was performed with the four identified variants, namely c.109+435G>A (rs73346254), c.109+463C>T (rs4498267), c.109+768C>G (rs4431364), and c.109+915_917ins/delTAG (rs148607624). The functional role of the associated polymorphisms was evaluated by luciferase reporter gene expression analyses and EMSA. RESULTS: A statistically significant increased frequency was observed in the patients for rs73346254A (P = 5 x 10(-4)) and rs148607624delTAG (P = 0.01) alleles. Among all the possible allele combinations, only the haplotype bearing both risk alleles showed a significantly higher frequency in the patients vs. controls (P = 4.7 x 10(-4)) and conferred a carrier risk of 4.19 (P = 1.2 x 10(-4)). This haplotype determined a significant decrease of the luciferase activity in comparison with a basal promoter and the other allelic combinations in GH4C and MCF7 cells (P = 4.6 x 10(-6); P = 5.5 x 10(-4), respectively). The EMSA showed a differential affinity for nuclear proteins for the alternative alleles of the two associated variations. CONCLUSIONS: Variations with a functional significance conferring susceptibility to CPHD have been identified in the PROP1 gene, indicating a multifactorial origin of this disorder in sporadic cases."

In patients with CLP, the frequency of coding mutations in FOXE1 fails to account for the risk attributable to this locus, suggesting that the common risk alleles reside in nearby regulatory elements. Using a combination of zebrafish and mouse transgenesis, we screened 15 conserved non-coding sequences for enhancer activity, identifying three that regulate expression in a tissue specific pattern consistent with endogenous foxe1 expression. These three, located -82.4, -67.7 and +22.6 kb from the FOXE1 start codon, are all active in the oral epithelium or branchial arches. The -67.7 and +22.6 kb elements are also active in the developing heart, and the -67.7 kb element uniquely directs expression in the developing thyroid. Within the -67.7 kb element is the SNP rs7850258 that is associated with all three diseases. Quantitative reporter assays in oral epithelial and thyroid cell lines show that the rs7850258 allele (G) associated with CLP and hypothyroidism has significantly greater enhancer activity than the allele associated with thyroid cancer (A). Moreover, consistent with predicted transcription factor binding differences, the -67.7 kb element containing rs7850258 allele G is significantly more responsive to both MYC and ARNT than allele A. By demonstrating that this common non-coding variant alters FOXE1 expression, we have identified at least in part the functional basis for the genetic risk of these seemingly disparate disorders. "

These three, located -82.4, -67.7 and +22.6 kb from the FOXE1 start codon, are all active in the oral epithelium or branchial arches. The -67.7 and +22.6 kb elements are also active in the developing heart, and the -67.7 kb element uniquely directs expression in the developing thyroid. Within the -67.7 kb element is the SNP rs7850258 that is associated with all three diseases. Quantitative reporter assays in oral epithelial and thyroid cell lines show that the rs7850258 allele (G) associated with CLP and hypothyroidism has significantly greater enhancer activity than the allele associated with thyroid cancer (A). Moreover, consistent with predicted transcription factor binding differences, the -67.7 kb element containing rs7850258 allele G is significantly more responsive to both MYC and ARNT than allele A. By demonstrating that this common non-coding variant alters FOXE1 expression, we have identified at least in part the functional basis for the genetic risk of these seemingly disparate disorders. "

    "passage_text": "Three common diseases, isolated cleft lip and cleft palate (CLP), hypothyroidism and thyroid cancer all map to the FOXE1 locus, but causative variants have yet to be identified. In patients with CLP, the frequency of coding mutations in FOXE1 fails to account for the risk attributable to this locus, suggesting that the common risk alleles reside in nearby regulatory elements. Using a combination of zebrafish and mouse transgenesis, we screened 15 conserved non-coding sequences for enhancer activity, identifying three that regulate expression in a tissue specific pattern consistent with endogenous foxe1 expression. These three, located -82.4, -67.7 and +22.6 kb from the FOXE1 start codon, are all active in the oral epithelium or branchial arches. The -67.7 and +22.6 kb elements are also active in the developing heart, and the -67.7 kb element uniquely directs expression in the developing thyroid.

    "passage_text": "Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for nonsyndromic orofacial clefts have identified multiple strongly associated regions, the causal variants are unknown. To address this, we selected 13 regions from GWASs and other studies, performed targeted sequencing in 1,409 Asian and European trios, and carried out a series of statistical and functional analyses. Within a cluster of strongly associated common variants near NOG, we found that one, rs227727, disrupts enhancer activity. We furthermore identified significant clusters of non-coding rare variants near NTN1 and NOG and found several rare coding variants likely to affect protein function, including four nonsense variants in ARHGAP29. We confirmed 48 de novo mutations and, based on best biological evidence available, chose two of these for functional assays. One mutation in PAX7 disrupted the DNA binding of the encoded transcription factor in an in vitro assay. The second, a non-coding mutation, disrupted the activity of a neural crest enhancer downstream of FGFR2 both in vitro and in vivo. This targeted sequencing study provides strong functional evidence implicating several specific variants as primary contributory risk alleles for nonsyndromic clefting in humans."

METHODS: Eight polymorphisms were genotyped in 334 NSCL/P patients and 955 controls. In addition, the GREM1 protein-coding region was sequenced in 96 NSCL/P patients.

The putative functional variant rs16969681, located in a region that has enhancer activity, was associated with a 2.6-fold lower risk for NSCL/P (odds ratio [OR] = 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.24-0.61, p = 2.37E-05). The previously reported association of rs1258763 with NSCL/P was replicated (OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44-0.73; p = 1.10E-05). For all tested GREM1 variants, no significant sex-by-genotype interaction effects were observed. The sequencing analysis did not detect any rare variants implicated in the development of oral clefts.
